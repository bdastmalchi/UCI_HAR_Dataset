The features selected for this database come from the Accelerometerelerometer and Gyroscopescope 3-axial raw signals timeAccelerometer-XYZ and timeGyroscope-XYZ. These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the Accelerometereleration signal was then separated into body and gravity Accelerometereleration signals (timeBodyAccelerometer-XYZ and timeGravityAccelerometer-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear Accelerometereleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (timeBodyAccelerometerJerk-XYZ and timeBodyGyroscopeJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (timeBodyAccelerometerMag, timeGravityAccelerometerMag, timeBodyAccelerometerJerkMag, timeBodyGyroscopeMag, timeBodyGyroscopeJerkMag). 

A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing frequencyBodyAccelerometer-XYZ, frequencyBodyAccelerometerJerk-XYZ, frequencyBodyGyroscope-XYZ, frequencyBodyAccelerometerJerkMag, frequencyBodyGyroscopeMag, frequencyBodyGyroscopeJerkMag. 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

A selected set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
timeBodyAccelerometerMean
timeBodyAccelerometerJerkMean
timeBodyGyroscopeMean
timeBodyGyroscopeJerkMean

In the end mean operation has been performed on each feature with regard to the activity for each subject.


The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in 'features_mean.txt'



Experimental setup:
======================================
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers, numbered as subjects, within an age bracket of 19-48 years.
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.
Using its embedded Accelerometerelerometer and Gyroscopescope, we captured 3-axial linear Accelerometereleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (Accelerometerelerometer and Gyroscopescope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor Accelerometereleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body Accelerometereleration and gravity.
The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.
